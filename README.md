You start in the middle of a desolate island. Enemies will spawn on all sides and approach you, trying to destroy you and your nexus. If either you or the nexus dies, the level is over. To defend yourself, there are a number of resources in the ground. You can extract them with mining drills, smelt them with furnaces, and then craft more buildings in your nexus. You win each level once all enemy waves are defeated.
